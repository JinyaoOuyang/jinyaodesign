## Overview

A leading fintech startup approached us to redesign their mobile banking application. The existing app suffered from low engagement and poor user reviews, primarily due to a confusing navigation structure and lack of trust signals.

The core challenge was balancing security requirements with a frictionless user experience—two goals that often seem at odds in financial products.
</Callout>

## Problem

Users were abandoning the app during critical flows like account setup and money transfers. Research revealed three main pain points:

1. **Complex navigation** — Users couldn't find basic features
2. **Lack of feedback** — Transactions felt uncertain and scary
3. **Visual clutter** — Too much information competing for attention

## Role

As Lead Product Designer, I owned the end-to-end design process from research through implementation. I collaborated closely with a product manager, two engineers, and the company's compliance team.

## Process

### Discovery

I started with a comprehensive audit of the existing app and competitive analysis of 12 banking apps. Then I conducted 15 user interviews to understand mental models around money management.

### Design Exploration

Based on research insights, I explored multiple directions for the core navigation and transaction flows. We tested three concepts with users before converging on a bottom-tab navigation with contextual actions.

**Before**: Hamburger menu with 12+ items buried in nested menus. Users averaged 4 taps to reach common actions.

</Column>
<Column>

**After**: Bottom tabs for 5 core areas with smart shortcuts. Most actions now require 2 taps or fewer.

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Iteration

We ran three rounds of usability testing, each time refining the interaction patterns and visual hierarchy. Key improvements included:

- Adding real-time transaction feedback with animations
- Simplifying the transfer flow from 7 steps to 3
- Introducing biometric authentication for faster access

## Solution

The final design introduced a calmer visual language with generous whitespace and a focused color palette. We created a component library with 40+ reusable elements to ensure consistency.

## Impact

Within 3 months of launch:

- **40% increase** in daily active users
- **4.8 rating** on the App Store (up from 3.2)
- **50% faster** average onboarding completion
- **60% reduction** in support tickets related to navigation

## Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of progressive disclosure in complex applications. By hiding advanced features until users need them, we reduced cognitive load while maintaining power-user capabilities.

Sometimes the best design decision is removing features, not adding them. We cut 30% of the original feature set, and user satisfaction increased dramatically.
