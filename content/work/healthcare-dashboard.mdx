## Overview

Healthcare administrators spend hours each day gathering data from multiple systems to understand hospital performance. We designed a unified dashboard that brings critical metrics together in an actionable, accessible format.

## Problem

Hospital administrators were using 5+ separate tools to track patient outcomes, bed availability, staffing levels, and financial metrics. This fragmentation led to:

- **Delayed decisions** due to slow data access
- **Errors** from manual data compilation
- **Burnout** among administrative staff

## Role

I served as Senior UX Designer on a cross-functional team including a data scientist, two front-end developers, and a healthcare domain expert. My focus was on information architecture and visualization design.

## Process

### Stakeholder Research

I conducted contextual inquiries with 8 hospital administrators across 4 facilities. Shadowing them revealed workflow patterns and pain points that wouldn't surface in traditional interviews.

### Information Architecture

Working with our data scientist, I mapped all available data sources and prioritized metrics based on frequency of use and decision-making impact.

### Visualization Design

For each metric type, I explored multiple visualization options, testing comprehension with users. Key decisions included:

<Column>

**Patient Flow**: Chose Sankey diagrams over tables to show movement between departments intuitively.

</Column>
<Column>

**Trends**: Used sparklines with clear benchmarks instead of complex line charts.

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Accessibility

Given the high-stakes environment, accessibility was paramount. All visualizations were designed to work for colorblind users, and we ensured keyboard navigation throughout.

## Solution

The final dashboard features:

- **Executive summary** with 6 key metrics at a glance
- **Drill-down capability** for detailed analysis
- **Customizable alerts** for threshold breaches
- **Export functionality** for board presentations

## Impact

After 3 months of deployment:

- **3 hours saved** per administrator per day
- **85% voluntary adoption** (no mandate required)
- **Zero formal training** needed—users were productive immediately
- **23% faster** response to capacity issues

## Learnings

Designing for data-heavy applications requires ruthless prioritization. Every chart must earn its place on screen. We removed 60% of initially requested visualizations, focusing only on metrics that drove action.
