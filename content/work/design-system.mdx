## Overview

An enterprise software company with 12 products had no unified design language. Each product team had developed their own components, leading to inconsistent experiences and duplicated effort. I led the creation of a shared design system.

## Problem

The lack of a design system caused multiple issues:

- **Inconsistent UX** across products confused users
- **Redundant work** as each team built similar components
- **Slow handoffs** due to lack of shared vocabulary
- **Accessibility gaps** with no standardized approach

<Callout type="insight">
We counted 23 different button styles across 12 products. Users learning one product had to relearn interactions for another.
</Callout>

## Role

As Design System Lead, I built and managed a team of 2 designers and 2 developers. I was responsible for system architecture, governance, and adoption strategy.

## Process

### Audit & Inventory

I conducted a comprehensive audit of all 12 products, cataloging every component, pattern, and style. This revealed both inconsistencies and opportunities for consolidation.

### Principles & Foundations

Before designing components, we established core principles and design tokens:

- **Color system** with semantic naming
- **Typography scale** with accessibility built in
- **Spacing system** based on 8px grid
- **Motion principles** for consistent animations

### Component Development

We prioritized components based on frequency of use and impact on consistency. Each component went through:

1. Design exploration and review
2. Accessibility audit
3. Development and testing
4. Documentation

**Design**: Figma components with variants, auto-layout, and detailed specifications.

**Development**: React components in Storybook with full prop documentation.

### Adoption Strategy

Building the system was only half the battle. We developed an adoption program including:

- **Migration guides** for each product team
- **Office hours** for questions and feedback
- **Contribution model** for team-specific needs
- **Champions program** with trained advocates

## Solution

The final design system includes:

- **100+ components** from buttons to complex data tables
- **30 patterns** for common user flows
- **Comprehensive documentation** on Zeroheight
- **Figma library** with weekly updates
- **npm packages** for development teams

## Impact

After one year:

- **60% faster** design-to-development time
- **12 products** migrated to the system
- **100% accessibility compliance** across all components
- **40% reduction** in design-related bugs
- **$1.2M estimated savings** from reduced redundancy

## Learnings

A design system is a product, not a project. It requires ongoing investment, governance, and community building. The technical components are often easier than the organizational change management.

The measure of a design system's success isn't how many components it has—it's how many people use it willingly.
