## Overview

A major online retailer was experiencing a 72% cart abandonment rate—significantly higher than industry average. I led the UX effort to identify friction points and redesign the checkout flow.

## Problem

Analytics showed users were dropping off at specific points:

1. **Account creation** (35% of abandonment)
2. **Shipping options** (25% of abandonment)
3. **Payment entry** (20% of abandonment)

<Callout type="insight">
Users wanted to complete their purchase quickly but felt forced into creating accounts and navigating confusing shipping options.
</Callout>

## Role

As UX Designer, I partnered with a product manager and conversion optimization specialist. I owned user research, design, and A/B test design.

## Process

### Quantitative Analysis

I worked with our analytics team to build a detailed funnel analysis, identifying exactly where and why users were leaving. Heatmaps revealed rage clicks on confusing form fields.

### Qualitative Research

I conducted 12 moderated usability tests, asking participants to complete purchases while thinking aloud. This revealed emotional friction points that analytics couldn't capture.

### Design Iterations

I redesigned the checkout in three phases, testing each with real users:

**Phase 1: Guest Checkout**
- Added prominent guest checkout option
- Moved account creation to post-purchase

**Phase 2: Shipping Clarity**
- Showed shipping costs upfront
- Added delivery date estimates
- Simplified option presentation

**Before**: 6 shipping options with complex pricing tiers confused users.

**After**: 3 clear options with estimated delivery dates and total costs.

**Phase 3: Payment Streamlining**
- Added digital wallet options (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- Implemented address autocomplete
- Reduced form fields by 40%

## Solution

The final checkout flow reduced steps from 5 pages to 3, with clear progress indication and inline validation. We implemented smart defaults based on user location and behavior.

## Impact

A/B testing against the original checkout showed:

- **28% reduction** in cart abandonment
- **$2.4M additional revenue** in first quarter
- **15% faster** average checkout time
- **4.2 to 4.6** increase in checkout satisfaction score

## Learnings

Small friction points compound into major abandonment. A one-second delay or one unnecessary field can cost millions in revenue. This project taught me to question every input field: "Is this truly necessary?"

The best checkout is the one users don't remember—it should feel effortless.
