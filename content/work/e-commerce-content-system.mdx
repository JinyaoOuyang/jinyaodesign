## Problem Statement

The Challenge

Flexi-Casa needed a custom, scalable e-commerce experience that:

- Was not constrained by Shopify themes
- Allowed full control over UX and branding
- Could ship fast without rebuilding commerce infrastructure
- Was maintainable by a small team

<Callout>
Traditional Shopify themes optimized for speed, but limited interaction design, layout flexibility, and long-term scalability.
</Callout>

## Why Headless Shopify

### Design & Architecture Decision

Instead of building a full custom backend, I chose a headless Shopify architecture:

Shopify handles:
- Inventory & variants
- Cart & checkout
- Payments & authentication

The custom storefront focuses on:
- UX
- UI systems
- Performance
- Brand consistency

<Callout>
Decoupling the storefront allows designers to ship high-quality experiences without rebuilding commerce fundamentals.

## Process: From Local to Production

### Phase 1 — Start with Data, Not Visuals

I began with local development, prioritizing system integrity over polish.

Validated early:
- Product data fetching
- Cart persistence
- Checkout handoff
- Account & signup flows

**Why this matters:**

Designing UI before validating data flow often leads to rework and brittle systems.

### Phase 2 — Shopify Integration

Once the storefront could seamlessly connect to Shopify’s backend:

- Product → Cart → Checkout worked end-to-end
- Inventory and variants were reliable
- Backend constraints were clear

Only after this point did UI decisions begin.

## UX & PDP System Design

### Product Detail Page as a System

Rather than designing a single PDP layout, I designed a PDP system:

- Clear hierarchy for product information
- Modular components for reuse
- Flexible layouts to support future SKUs
- Optimized CTA placement for clarity

## Visual Design & Branding

### Consistent Brand Experience

After the system foundation was validated, I refined:

- Typography
- Color usage
- Spacing and rhythm
- Cross-page consistency

The goal was to ensure the storefront felt intentionally designed, not theme-derived.

## AI-Assisted Development

### How AI Changed the Workflow

AI coding tools (including WinXurf) were used to:

- Scaffold storefront components
- Accelerate API integration
- Reduce boilerplate setup
- Iterate faster between design and implementation

**Key takeaway:**
AI didn’t replace design decisions — it reduced execution friction.

This made it realistic for a designer to:

- Prototype
- Build
- Validate
- Ship

## Deployment & Launch
The storefront was deployed using Netlify:

- Environment variables for Shopify APIs
- Secure token handling
- Custom domain connection
- Production data validation

## Impact & Outcomes

### Results

- Fully custom storefront without Shopify theme constraints
- Faster iteration between UX and implementation
- Scalable PDP and design system foundation
- Production-ready deployment with minimal backend overhead

## Reflection

### What I Learned

- Headless commerce works best when UX and system design are aligned
- Validating data flow early saves significant design rework
- Shopify is a designer-friendly backend when used headlessly
- AI makes designer-led product development realistically achievable

<Callout>
This project was built as a production system for Flexi-Casa.
The repository is currently private, but I’m happy to discuss architecture, tradeoffs, and workflows in detail.
