> A real production case study using AI coding tools, Shopify APIs, and Netlify

Over the past year, AI coding tools and so-called “AI agencies” have dramatically lowered the barrier to building real products. What used to require a full engineering team is now increasingly achievable by a single designer — **if the platform and architecture choices are right**.

In this article, I want to share how I built a **production-ready headless Shopify storefront** for **Flexi-Casa**, using AI-assisted development tools and Shopify’s backend ecosystem.  
This was **not a personal demo**, but a real company project that went from local testing to live deployment.

My goal is not to teach Shopify basics, but to show **why this approach works so well for designers**, and how AI changes the “who can ship” question.

The live Flexi-Casa headless Shopify storefront, built and deployed as a production system.

### Why Headless Shopify Makes Sense for Designers

Traditional Shopify themes are powerful, but they tightly couple **presentation (UI)** with **business logic (backend)**. That tradeoff is fine for many merchants — but limiting if you care deeply about:

*   Custom UX flows
*   Performance and interaction design
*   Scalable design systems
*   Brand consistency beyond theme constraints

Headless commerce flips this model.

With Shopify, you get:

*   Inventory tracking
*   Product and variant management
*   Checkout, payments, taxes
*   Authentication and customer accounts

All of this lives in Shopify’s backend.  
Your job becomes much simpler:

> Build the storefront UI. Connect it to Shopify via APIs.

For a UX or Product Designer, this is a huge unlock.

Decoupling the storefront from Shopify’s backend enables full control over UX while reusing proven commerce infrastructure.

### The Role of AI in This Project

AI didn’t “magically build everything” — but it **changed the slope of development**.

I used AI coding tools (including Winsurf) to:

*   Scaffold storefront components
*   Generate API connection logic
*   Iterate on UI states faster
*   Reduce boilerplate and setup time

Instead of spending days wiring basic flows, I could focus on:

*   Information hierarchy
*   PDP (Product Detail Page) structure
*   Interaction clarity
*   Visual system consistency

AI became a **force multiplier**, not a replacement for design judgment.

### My Development Workflow (End to End)

This project followed a very intentional sequence.

#### **1\. Start Local, Not Visual**

I began by setting everything up **locally**.

The first priority was **data flow**, not UI polish:

*   Fetch products from Shopify Storefront API
*   Add to cart
*   Persist cart state
*   Trigger checkout
*   Handle signup/account flows

At this stage, the UI was intentionally basic.

Why?  
Because **a beautiful UI on broken data is wasted effort**.

Local development focused on validating data flow first — products, cart, and checkout fully connected to Shopify before visual polish.

#### **2\. Validate the Full Shopify Integration**

Once the local storefront could:

*   Seamlessly connect to Shopify
*   Correctly handle inventory and variants
*   Complete checkout through Shopify’s backend

…I knew the foundation was solid.

This is where Shopify truly shines:  
you’re not reinventing commerce infrastructure — you’re **composing it**.

#### 3\. UI, PDP Systems, and Branding

Only after the backend flow was stable did I move into UI refinement:

*   PDP layout and hierarchy
*   Product imagery behavior
*   Typography and spacing rules
*   Brand color and visual rhythm

This mirrors how I think about **design systems**:  
structure first, polish second.

Because the storefront was headless, I had full control over:

*   Layout logic
*   Interaction patterns
*   Visual consistency across pages

No theme limitations. No Liquid constraints.

Designing the Product Detail Page after backend integration, focusing on hierarchy, clarity, and scalable component structure.

#### 4\. Deployment with Netlify

Once everything worked locally, deployment was straightforward.

Key steps:

*   Configure Shopify API keys and public tokens
*   Set environment variables in Netlify
*   Connect the custom domain
*   Validate production data flow

Because Shopify handles checkout securely, the deployment surface area stays relatively small.

From local development to production deployment — completing the full build-to-launch cycle.

### Why This Matters for UX & Product Designers

Here’s the bigger takeaway.

In 2026, with:

*   Mature headless platforms
*   Robust APIs
*   AI coding assistants

**Designers no longer need to stop at “handoff.”**

Especially in e-commerce, Shopify removes most backend complexity.  
Your responsibility becomes:

> Design and build the storefront experience — not the entire commerce stack.

This opens real possibilities:

*   Designers shipping MVPs independently
*   Faster experimentation
*   Stronger design–engineering alignment
*   Better portfolios grounded in real systems

### What I Learned

A few honest lessons from this project:

*   Headless is powerful, but only if you understand product structure
*   AI accelerates execution, not decision-making
*   Starting with data flow saves massive rework later
*   Shopify is one of the most designer-friendly backend platforms available

Iteration from early functional layouts to a refined, brand-aligned storefront experience.

### Final Thoughts

This project reinforced something I strongly believe:

> The future Product Designer is not just a thinker — but a builder.

You don’t need to become a full-time engineer.  
But understanding how products are actually shipped gives you leverage, speed, and clarity.

If you’re a UX or Product Designer curious about headless commerce, AI-assisted development, or building real products from zero — this path is more accessible than it’s ever been.

_Note: The repository for this project is currently private, as it is a production system for Flexi-Casa. However, I’m happy to discuss architectural decisions, workflows, and tradeoffs._
