_Not to replace design thinking — but to remove friction across product, content, and visual design._

Working in an e-commerce startup often means wearing multiple hats.

In my day-to-day work, I’m involved in product understanding, content strategy, image design, and final layout — sometimes all at once. Over time, I realized that the biggest challenge wasn’t execution speed, but **mental friction**: switching contexts, organizing incomplete information, and making early-stage decisions under uncertainty.

That’s where AI became truly useful.

Not as a “design replacement,” but as a system that supports **thinking, structure, and momentum**.

### 1\. Product Understanding: Turning Noise into Signal

Every project starts with a product we need to sell.

The problem? Product information rarely arrives clean. It’s often scattered across supplier docs, internal messages, or half-formed ideas.

Before designing anything, I need clarity:

*   What problem does this product solve?
*   What makes it different?
*   Why should users care?

This is where I use AI — especially ChatGPT — as a **thinking amplifier**.

I feed it raw notes, rough descriptions, or unstructured ideas, and ask it to:

*   Separate features from benefits
*   Surface potential user motivations
*   Reframe product value from different perspectives

I don’t accept the output blindly. Instead, I use it to **react, refine, and decide faster**.

### 2\. Platform Context: One Product, Many Realities

In my work, the same product often needs to perform across multiple platforms:  
Shopify, Amazon, Target, and Wayfair.

Each platform has its own logic:

*   Amazon prioritizes clarity, comparison, and credibility
*   Shopify allows storytelling and brand voice
*   Target and Wayfair emphasize lifestyle context and trust

AI helps me quickly:

*   Compare platform requirements
*   Identify content priorities per channel
*   Shift my mindset without losing consistency

Instead of memorizing rules, I externalize them — and focus on decisions that actually matter.

### 3\. Content Design: Structuring Before Styling

Before touching visuals, I break content down into clear categories:

*   Listing images
*   Landing pages
*   A+ or enhanced content

This step is less about creativity and more about **information architecture**.

I use AI to:

*   List required content blocks
*   Identify what must appear above the fold
*   Distinguish functional content from emotional storytelling

Once the structure is clear, design becomes execution — not guesswork.

### 4\. Image Planning: Designing the Brief Before the Image

One of the biggest improvements in my workflow came from planning images _before_ designing them.

I use AI to:

*   Translate product features into visual goals
*   Write clear image briefs
*   Generate structured image prompts in natural language

This reduces rework and aligns visuals with strategy early.

### 5\. Image Creation: AI for Range, Designers for Taste

For image production, my workflow combines:

*   AI-generated backgrounds and concepts (ChatGPT / Gemini)
*   Photoshop’s AI features for refinement
*   Human judgment for realism, consistency, and brand fit

AI gives me **speed and exploration**.  
Design gives me **taste and responsibility**.

The final decision is always human.

### 6\. Final Assembly in Figma: Designing with Confidence

By the time I move into Figma, most ambiguity is gone.

AI has already helped me:

*   Think through the problem
*   Structure the content
*   Reduce uncertainty

At this stage, I’m not struggling to decide _what_ to design — I’m focused on _how well_ it communicates.

### What AI Really Does in My Workflow

AI doesn’t replace design thinking.

It replaces:

*   Blank-page anxiety
*   Repetitive mental work
*   Early-stage confusion

Its real value is **momentum**.

AI helps me move from uncertainty to something concrete — faster — so I can spend more energy on judgment, clarity, and quality.

### Final Thought

In a startup environment, speed matters — but **clarity matters more**.

AI works best when it supports thinking, not when it replaces responsibility.

I don’t use AI to design _for_ me.  
I use it to design **with** me.
