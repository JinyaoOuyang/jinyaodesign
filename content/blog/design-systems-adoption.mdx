Most design systems fail not because of poor components, but because of poor adoption. After years of building and consulting on design systems, I've identified the patterns that separate successful systems from expensive shelf-ware.

## The Adoption Problem

A design system without users is just a component library gathering dust. I've seen teams spend months building beautiful, comprehensive systems that no one uses. The components are technically excellent, but they sit unused while product teams continue building their own solutions.

Why does this happen?

## Mistake #1: Building in Isolation

The most common failure mode is building a design system without involving the people who will use it. A small team disappears for six months, emerges with a "finished" system, and expects everyone to adopt it immediately.

This approach fails because:

- **No buy-in**: Teams weren't part of the process, so they feel no ownership
- **Wrong priorities**: Components don't match actual product needs
- **Missing context**: Edge cases and constraints weren't considered

### The Fix: Co-Create from Day One

Involve product teams from the beginning. Not just as reviewers, but as active contributors. When teams help build the system, they're invested in its success.

Start by solving real problems from real products. Extract patterns from existing work rather than designing in the abstract.

## Mistake #2: Prioritizing Perfection Over Progress

Some teams delay launch indefinitely, waiting until every component is "perfect." Meanwhile, product teams can't wait—they build their own solutions, creating more inconsistency.

### The Fix: Ship Early and Iterate

Launch with a minimal viable system: typography, color, spacing, and a handful of essential components. Get it into production quickly, then iterate based on real usage.

A good-enough system in use today beats a perfect system that ships next year.

## Mistake #3: Ignoring Developer Experience

Design systems serve two audiences: designers and developers. Many systems focus heavily on designer tooling (Figma libraries, design tokens) while neglecting the developer experience.

If developers find your components hard to use, they'll build their own. Every custom component is a deviation from your system.

### The Fix: Treat DX as a First-Class Concern

Invest in:

- **Clear documentation** with code examples
- **Sensible defaults** that work out of the box
- **Flexible APIs** that handle real-world edge cases
- **Great error messages** when things go wrong

Work closely with developers throughout the design process. Their constraints and needs should shape component APIs from the start.

## Mistake #4: No Clear Governance

Who decides when to add a new component? How are changes approved? What happens when a team needs something the system doesn't provide?

Without clear answers, teams either:
- Wait indefinitely for system updates
- Build custom solutions without system involvement
- Fork the system into incompatible variants

### The Fix: Establish Lightweight Governance

Create a clear contribution model:

1. **Request process**: How teams propose additions or changes
2. **Review criteria**: What makes something system-worthy
3. **Approval flow**: Who decides and how quickly
4. **Contribution path**: How teams can contribute directly

The goal is enabling, not gatekeeping. Make it easier to work with the system than around it.

## Mistake #5: Treating It as a Project, Not a Product

Design systems need ongoing investment. Teams that build a system then move on to other projects watch their system slowly decay into irrelevance.

### The Fix: Dedicate Resources Long-Term

A design system needs:

- **Dedicated maintainers** (at least part-time)
- **Regular release cadence**
- **Active community management**
- **Continuous improvement based on feedback**

Budget for this from the start. If leadership won't commit to ongoing investment, the system will fail.

## The Path Forward

Successful design systems share common traits:

- **Solve real problems** for real teams
- **Ship incrementally** rather than waiting for perfection
- **Serve both designers and developers** equally well
- **Enable contribution** rather than controlling
- **Evolve continuously** with dedicated resources

Building the components is the easy part. The hard part is building the organization and culture around them.
