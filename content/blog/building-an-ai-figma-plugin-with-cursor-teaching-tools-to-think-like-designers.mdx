As a designer who often works on e-commerce projects, I spend hours creating Amazon listing images — main, lifestyle, infographics, and so on.  
So I wondered: what if I could build a Figma plugin that uses AI to do it for me?

**Why Cursor?**

I used Cursor, an AI-assisted code editor, to build this plugin from scratch.  
As someone with a design background and limited coding experience, Cursor helped me translate design ideas into code faster.  
I could describe UI logic in plain language — and Cursor generated the Figma Plugin API code.

I’ve also experimented with Windsurf, another AI-assisted coding tool. While it’s powerful, it doesn’t yet feel intuitive enough for designers. Over the past six months, I’ve been exploring a range of what I call “vibe coding” tools — AI tools that blend creativity and code — and I’ll share more of my thoughts and lessons learned in future articles.

Code in Cursor

**How the Plugin Works**

The plugin takes a product image, detects its type, and generates six Amazon listing images — main, lifestyle, infographic, and more.  
It uses AI prompts to create contextual backgrounds and automatically arranges them on a canvas.

How the plugin help me design the listing

**What Went Wrong**

While the workflow worked, the results weren’t perfect.  
Some backgrounds looked unrealistic or contextually wrong — a sword floating in the sky, or a katana placed on a beach.  
It reminded me that AI can recognize objects, but not _design intent._ Or sometimes not accurate enough.

**Reflection**

Building this taught me two things:

1.  Cursor is an incredible bridge between designers and code.

2\. AI still needs UX designers to guide it — to teach it the language of context, tone, and emotion.

**Next Steps**

I plan to improve the plugin by:

1.  Adding a “style reference” input to teach AI brand tone
2.  Improving product detection accuracy. Right now, I’m using Salesforce’s blip-image-captioning-base model for image detection. It works decently, though I’m exploring whether a more advanced model might better capture visual context.

3\. Building a feedback loop for users to rate AI results

> AI won’t replace designers — but designers who build AI will shape the next generation of tools.
