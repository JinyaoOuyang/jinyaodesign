_This is Part 3 of my series on using AI tools as a designer. Previously, I wrote about_ [_how vibe coding changes how we think about building_](https://ginouyang.medium.com/vibe-coding-lowered-the-barrier-to-building-but-raised-the-bar-for-thinking-78ba08dbbb42) _and_ [_shipping a production Shopify storefront_](https://ginouyang.medium.com/from-ux-designer-to-builder-shipping-a-headless-shopify-storefront-with-ai-bbca7f9b9f81)_. This time, I’m building something more personal: my own portfolio._

As a UX/Product Designer, I’ve always believed in “designing systems, not just screens.” But when it came to building my own portfolio website, I realized I needed to practice what I preach — and go beyond mockups to create a real, production-ready site.

After shipping a [headless Shopify storefront](https://ginouyang.medium.com/from-ux-designer-to-builder-shipping-a-headless-shopify-storefront-with-ai-bbca7f9b9f81) for my e-commerce startup, I had the confidence to tackle my personal site. The result? [jinyaodesign.com](https://www.jinyaodesign.com/) — a Next.js portfolio that I built in 1 week using “vibe coding” with AI tools.

In this article, I’ll walk you through my design thinking, AI collaboration workflow, and practical lessons learned that any designer can apply.

### The Vision: What I Wanted to Build

As a designer, I had clear requirements for my portfolio:

#### Design Goals

*   **Clean, minimal aesthetic** that puts work front and center
*   **Fast loading** with optimized images
*   **Responsive design** that works beautifully on all devices
*   **Easy to update** — I wanted to add blog posts and projects without wrestling with code

#### Technical Requirements

*   Modern tech stack (Next.js for SEO and performance)
*   Markdown-based content management for blog posts
*   Image optimization
*   Smooth animations and transitions
*   Integration with Medium for blog syndication

The challenge? I’m a designer, not a developer. Traditional routes would mean:

1.  Spending months learning React and Next.js
2.  Hiring a developer (expensive and slow iteration)
3.  Using a no-code tool (what I used before, limited and often bloated)

Instead, I chose vibe coding with AI.

### My AI Toolkit: ChatGPT/GPT-4 + Windsurf

For my [Shopify storefront project](https://ginouyang.medium.com/from-ux-designer-to-builder-shipping-a-headless-shopify-storefront-with-ai-bbca7f9b9f81), I relied heavily on Windsurf and ChatGPT. This time, I did the same combination:

#### ChatGPT/GPT-4

*   **Initial architecture decisions**: “Should I use Next.js or Gatsby? What’s the best way to handle markdown blog posts?”
*   **Component logic**: Explaining what I wanted in plain English and getting React component code
*   **Problem-solving**: When something broke, I’d paste the error and get debugging help
*   **Design system decisions**: Discussing color schemes, typography scales, spacing systems

#### Windsurf

*   **Real-time coding assistance**: Windsurf helped me write and edit code directly in my editor
*   **Contextual suggestions**: It understood the codebase structure and suggested relevant code
*   **Rapid iteration**: I could make changes and see results immediately
*   **Learning by doing**: Instead of reading documentation, I learned by seeing Windsurf’s suggestions

The combination was powerful: ChatGPT for strategic thinking and architecture, Windsurf for tactical execution.

**Key difference from my Shopify project**: The Shopify storefront required more API integration and data fetching logic. This portfolio was more frontend-focused, which made ChatGPT + Windsurf a perfect fit for rapid UI development.

### The Design Process: Thinking in Systems

Even with AI tools, good design thinking was essential. Here’s how I approached it:

#### 1\. Content-First Structure

I started by mapping out my content hierarchy:

Homepage  
├── Hero (Name + Tagline)  
├── Featured Work (4 projects)  
├── Latest Writing (2 blog posts)  
└── Contact

Work Page  
├── Project Grid  
└── Filter by Category

Blog Page  
├── Blog Post List  
└── Individual Post Pages

About Page  
└── Personal Story

This structure informed my component architecture. Each section became a reusable React component.

#### 2\. Design System from Day One

Rather than designing everything pixel-perfect in Figma first, I defined my design system in code:

*   **Color palette**: 3 neutral grays + 1 accent color
*   **Typography**: Two fonts (Inter for UI, system font stack for body)
*   **Spacing scale**: 4px base unit (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96)
*   **Breakpoints**: Mobile (< 640px), Tablet (< 1024px), Desktop (≥ 1024px)

I prompted ChatGPT: _“Create a Tailwind config with this design system. Use semantic color names.”_

The result was a consistent, maintainable design system that AI could reference throughout the project.

#### 3\. Component-Driven Development

I thought in components from the start:

*   **ProjectCard**: Reusable for work grid
*   **BlogCard**: For blog post previews
*   **Navigation**: Responsive header with mobile menu
*   **Footer**: Contact links and social media

For each component, I’d describe the desired behavior:

> _“Create a ProjectCard component with an image, title, description, and tags. On hover, the image should slightly zoom and the card should lift with a shadow. Make it responsive.”_

ChatGPT would generate the structured prompts, I’d paste them into Windsurf, and iterate from there.

### The AI Collaboration Workflow

Here’s my actual workflow for building a feature — it’s more strategic than you might think:

#### Step 1: Requirements Planning with ChatGPT

I start by having a conversation with ChatGPT to clarify what I’m trying to build:

**Me**: “I need a blog section for my homepage. It should show recent posts and integrate with my Medium feed.”

**ChatGPT**: “Let me help you break this down. What do you need?”

*   Data source (Medium RSS or local markdown?)
*   Number of posts to display
*   Information for each post (image, date, title, excerpt?)
*   Layout (grid or list?)
*   Responsive behavior

Through this conversation, ChatGPT helps me think through edge cases and technical considerations I might have missed as a designer.

#### Step 2: Generating Structured Prompts

Once the requirements are clear, I ask ChatGPT to generate structured prompts for specific tasks:

**Me**: “Create a structured prompt for building the blog card component.”

**ChatGPT returns**:

Create a BlogCard React component with the following requirements:  
\- Props: image (string), date (string), title (string), excerpt (string), url (string)  
\- Layout: Image at top (16:9 aspect ratio), date below (small gray text),   
  title (h3, 2 lines max with ellipsis), excerpt (3 lines max)  
\- Styling: Use Tailwind CSS, card should have subtle shadow and hover lift effect  
\- Responsive: Full width on mobile, maintain aspect ratios  
\- Accessibility: Proper alt text, semantic HTML

This structured prompt becomes my specification. It’s detailed but flexible enough for implementation.

#### Step 3: Tactical Execution in Windsurf

Now I take that structured prompt to Windsurf. Here’s where it gets interesting — **I don’t just use one model**. I choose the right model for each specific problem:

**For component structure and logic:**

*   Paste the structured prompt into Windsurf
*   Choose Claude (better at understanding component architecture)
*   Get the initial implementation

**For styling and animation details:**

*   Select specific code sections
*   Switch to GPT-4 (often better at CSS/Tailwind nuances)
*   Ask: “Make the hover animation smoother and add a subtle scale effect”

**For bug fixing:**

*   When something breaks, I describe the issue
*   Use Claude for complex logic bugs
*   Use GPT-4 for styling issues

This model-switching strategy is key. Different models have different strengths, and Windsurf makes it easy to use the right tool for each job.

#### Step 4: Visual Iteration

I run the dev server constantly and iterate based on what I see:

*   “The spacing between cards feels too tight.” → Ask in Windsurf
*   “The featured image needs more contrast.” → Adjust directly with AI suggestion
*   “The date should be smaller and less prominent.” → Quick refinement

The beauty of this workflow: **ChatGPT is my strategic partner for planning, Windsurf is my tactical partner for execution.**

### Why This Workflow Works

#### **ChatGPT’s role:**

*   Broader context and architectural thinking
*   Helps me structure my requirements clearly
*   Generates reusable prompts I can adapt for similar tasks
*   No context switching — I can have long planning sessions

#### **Windsurf’s role:**

*   Direct code manipulation in my actual project
*   Model selection based on the specific problem
*   Real-time feedback and syntax checking
*   Sees my entire codebase for context-aware suggestions

This separation of concerns makes the process incredibly efficient. I’m not asking ChatGPT to write code I then copy-paste. I’m using it to think, then using Windsurf to build.

### Key Decisions and Tradeoffs

#### Image Optimization

I used **Next.js Image component** with a custom loader:

*   Automatically generates responsive image sizes
*   Lazy loading out of the box
*   WebP format for better compression

This was an area where AI really shone— I didn’t need to understand the intricacies of image optimization. I just described what I wanted, and ChatGPT configured it correctly.

#### Animation Philosophy

I kept animations **subtle and purposeful**:

*   Hover states for interactive elements
*   Smooth page transitions
*   Loading states for images

I asked ChatGPT: _“Give me a subtle hover animation for project cards using Tailwind and Framer Motion.”_

The result was elegant and performant.

### Practical Tips for Designers Who Want to Vibe Code

Based on my experience, here’s what I’d recommend:

#### 1\. Start with Design System Clarity

Before writing any code, define:

*   Color palette (give colors semantic names)
*   Typography scale
*   Spacing system
*   Component inventory

This gives AI clear constraints to work within.

#### 2\. Use Design Language When Prompting

Don’t say: _“Add a div with padding-top: 20px”_

Instead, say: _“Add comfortable breathing room above this section.”_

AI understands design intent better than you’d think.

#### 3\. Use ChatGPT to Generate Structured Prompts

This is a game-changer. Instead of directly asking AI to code, use ChatGPT to help you create detailed, structured prompts first.

**Bad approach:** Going directly to Windsurf: “Make me a navigation bar.”

**Better approach:**

1.  Chat with ChatGPT: “I need a navigation bar. Help me think through the requirements.”
2.  ChatGPT helps you define: mobile behavior, active states, dropdown menus, accessibility
3.  Ask: “Create a structured prompt for this.”
4.  Take that prompt to Windsurf

This two-step process ensures you’ve thought through the problem before coding. ChatGPT becomes your requirements analyst, not just your code generator.

### 4\. Choose the Right Model for Each Task

In Windsurf, you can switch between different AI models. Use this to your advantage:

*   **Claude**: Better for component architecture, complex logic, and understanding relationships between files
*   **GPT-4**: Often better for styling details, CSS/Tailwind finesse, animation tweaks
*   **Experiment**: Different models have different strengths. Try both and see what works

Don’t feel locked into one model. The best builders know when to switch tools.

#### 5\. Iterate Visually, Not Just Conceptually

Run your dev server constantly. See the changes in the browser. Design is a visual medium — code is just the tool.

#### 6\. Learn by Doing, Not by Tutorial

I didn’t take a React course before starting. I learned by building, asking AI questions when stuck, and reading the code it generated.

This “learn by necessity” approach was much faster than traditional learning.

#### 7\. Version Control is Your Friend

Use Git from day one. Commit often. When AI suggests something that breaks your site, you can easily roll back.

#### 8\. Don’t Optimize Prematurely

Get it working first. Make it pretty second. Optimize third.

AI sometimes suggests complex optimizations early on. Ignore them until you need them.

#### 9\. Trust Your Design Eye

If something feels off visually, it probably is — even if the code is “correct.” Your design instincts are valuable. Use them.

### The Results

After 1–2 weeks of vibe coding, I had:

*   A fully functional portfolio with 4 project case studies
*   A blog integrated with Medium
*   Optimized images and fast load times
*   Responsive design that works on all devices
*   SEO-friendly structure with proper meta tags
*   A codebase I understand and can maintain

**Load time**: < 1 second  
**Lighthouse score**: 95+ across all metrics  
**Mobile responsive**: Yes  
**Easy to update**: Yes

More importantly, I learned:

*   React fundamentals
*   Next.js architecture
*   Modern CSS (Tailwind)
*   How to collaborate effectively with AI
*   How to ship products, not just designs

### The Future of Design

This experience — combined with my work on the [Shopify storefront](https://ginouyang.medium.com/from-ux-designer-to-builder-shipping-a-headless-shopify-storefront-with-ai-bbca7f9b9f81) and [daily AI workflow optimizations](https://ginouyang.medium.com/how-i-use-ai-to-speed-up-my-workflow-as-a-designer-in-an-e-commerce-startup-c8c80c164563) — has convinced me that the line between designer and developer is blurring faster than we think.

AI doesn’t replace design thinking — it amplifies it. You still need to:

*   Understand user needs
*   Define clear information architecture
*   Make aesthetic decisions
*   Iterate based on feedback

But now, designers can ship their own ideas without waiting for developers or learning to code the traditional way.

**This is powerful.**

It means:

*   Faster iteration cycles
*   More control over the final product
*   Ability to experiment without risk
*   Learning by building, not by studying

As I mentioned in my article on [how vibe coding changes our thinking](https://ginouyang.medium.com/vibe-coding-lowered-the-barrier-to-building-but-raised-the-bar-for-thinking-78ba08dbbb42), the barrier to building is lower — but the bar for strategic thinking is higher. You need to know what you want to build and why, even if you don’t know how to build it.

### Should You Try Vibe Coding?

If you’re a designer who:

*   Wants more control over your portfolio or side projects
*   Is curious about code but intimidated by traditional learning paths
*   Enjoys iterating quickly and seeing results
*   Has clear design vision and wants to bring it to life

Then yes, absolutely try vibe coding.

Start small:

1.  Build a single landing page
2.  Add a contact form
3.  Create a blog
4.  Launch it

You’ll be surprised how much you can accomplish with AI as your coding partner.

### Final Thoughts

Building [jinyaodesign.com](http://jinyaodesign.com) taught me that the best way to learn is by doing — and AI makes “doing” accessible to everyone.

Over the past few months, I’ve gone from a designer who occasionally dabbled in code to someone who can:

*   Ship a production [Shopify storefront](https://ginouyang.medium.com/from-ux-designer-to-builder-shipping-a-headless-shopify-storefront-with-ai-bbca7f9b9f81)
*   Build and maintain a [portfolio site](https://www.jinyaodesign.com/)
*   Use [AI to accelerate my daily design workflow](https://ginouyang.medium.com/how-i-use-ai-to-speed-up-my-workflow-as-a-designer-in-an-e-commerce-startup-c8c80c164563)

I didn’t become a developer overnight. I’m still a designer first. But now I’m a designer who can ship functional products, iterate rapidly, and maintain my own codebase.

That’s the power of vibe coding.

**What’s next?** I’m exploring how to use AI for more complex interactions — things like real-time data visualization, interactive components, and even [building Figma plugins](https://ginouyang.medium.com/building-an-ai-figma-plugin-with-cursor-teaching-tools-to-think-like-designers-001c5bbdf393).
